While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the Metro bundler, specifically concerning the resolution of dependencies. The error message was not very informative, only mentioning that it couldn't resolve a module despite having the dependency correctly listed in package.json.  This occurred intermittently, sometimes working after multiple attempts at running `expo start`.  The specific error message varied but generally indicated a failure to find a particular package within node_modules, even though `npm install` or `yarn install` reported success.  The project uses a mix of native modules (written in Objective-C) and Javascript libraries.
